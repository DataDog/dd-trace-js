        current capital of France is Paris. It has been the capital since 1958 and
        is also the most populous city in the country. Paris has a rich history and
        is known for its iconic landmarks and cultural significance.\n\nThe history
        of the capital of France is somewhat complex, with the city of Paris itself
        having a long and fascinating past. There was a shift in the capital''s location
        over the centuries, with various cities and towns fulfilling the role. The
        earliest French capital based on historical records is thought to be the city
        of Tours. The capital moved to various locations, often due to political and
        dynastic reasons, including cities like Reims and Orleans. Paris initially
        became the capital during the era of the Louvre in the 14th century, under
        the rule of King Philip IV.\n\nThe status of Paris as the capital of France
        has been reaffirmed many times, even during the French Revolution and the
        establishment of the First French Empire by Napoleon Bonaparte. The city''s
        significance grew further with its designation as the centre of the Department
        of Seine. Paris remained the capital through the changes in regime, including
        the restoration of the monarchy, the July Monarchy, the Second Empire, and
        the establishment of the French Third Republic.\n\nModern France''s political
        system, following the end of the Second World War, saw the capital remain
        in Paris. The city continues to be a cultural hub, attracting artists, writers,
        and musicians from around the world. Paris remains a prominent global city,
