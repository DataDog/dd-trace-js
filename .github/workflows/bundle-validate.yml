    # which pushes the generated `vendor/dist/*` contents. Running this workflow before that
    # push is expected to fail (it will regenerate `vendor/dist/*` and see a diff).

    # Instead, Dependabot vendor PRs are validated after `vendor-push` via the `vendor-validate`
    # job in `dependabot-automation.yml`, ensuring correct ordering and avoiding flakiness.
