      # NOTE: Ok this next bit seems unnecessary, right? The problem is that
      # this repo is currently incompatible with npm, at least with the
      # devDependencies. While this is intended to be corrected, it hasn't yet,
      # so the easiest thing to do here is just use a fresh package.json. This
      # is needed because actionlint runs an `npm install` at the beginning.
