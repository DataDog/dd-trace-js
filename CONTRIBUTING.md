# Contributing to dd-trace-js

As an open source project we welcome contributions of many forms, but due to the experimental pre-beta nature
of this repository, you should reach out before starting work on any major code changes.
This will ensure we avoid duplicating work, or that your code can't be merged due to a rapidly changing
base. If you have any questions, create a [GitHub issue][1] and reach us!
